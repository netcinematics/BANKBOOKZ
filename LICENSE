B. Not financial advice, must abide AI regulation.

C. Does not guarantee profits. This is a study of data visualzation 1st.
   Capabilities of any ai potential - is separate from data visualization.

D. This software is OPEN-SOURCE as a basis,
 for eventual closed source iterations with innovative ai potential.
 
E. Original vision - personal_ledger_system. I really wanted to know PROFIT/LOSS 
   as accurate as possible.

F. More precise views, of exactly what was happening, in visual terms.

G. A dashboard of exactly, how finances exist, in trends and patterns, and math,
   and how to transfer that knowledge from the bankbookz, into my awareness.

H. Still in development - do not use for production purposes, 
     this is an experimental boiler-plate.
