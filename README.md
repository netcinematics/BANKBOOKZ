# BANKBOOKZ(tm):

Advanced Data Visualization software for AI.

## OVERVIEW: 

Rich FrontEnd, Personal_Ledger_System - in pure JavaScript. 

I couldn't understand why this didn't exist... so I built it!
It wasn't easy. But I had a clear vision of what was needed.
And I couldn't find it anywhere.

A highly customized, DREAM DASHBOARD, of Data Visualizations.
With an INNOVATIVE MIX of light-weight charts.

Built on BANKBOOKZ_Template, and enhanced with MODULES.
Demonstrates existing potential for DATA VISIUALIZATION.
And also a boilerplate for AI experimentation.
Potentially, with DESIGN PATTERNS from ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE:
 NLP, LLM, ENCODE and DECODE with LocalStorage DB.

## Description

The TICKR TAB displays any ticker for bankbookz tracking,
that will show throughout the system. 

Initial app displays default data - to show capabilities of CHARTS.
New data can be imported as JSON. Data formats vary widely.
Standard JSON {o:0,h:0,l:0,c:0} over UTC time.
Time is tricky, sometimes UTC sometimes yyyy-mm-dd.
Not easy, but possible to import/log out data in Data Gallery.

In BOOKZ (CHART_VIEW), is designed to show MONTHLY progress.
The MONTHLY PROGRESS is to be combined calculations. 
Where overall Profit and Loss, should be seen (for the 1st time)
across various assests, and different months.
